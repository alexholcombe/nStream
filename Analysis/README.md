* See if there's a way to convert to ms from JASP's effect size estimates
* Laken's equivalence test
* could do a 1 way t-test where we subtract 20ms from the latency difference. Gives probability for data less than 20ms under null of 20ms. 
	* Need to worry about power then. 
	* Have many 2-stream latency estimates. So we can use the distribution of those estimates to get the SE of our null.
