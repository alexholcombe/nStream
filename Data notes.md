* ID code protocol
	* initials + participant number
		* i.e. CL1
* There's a bug that leads to incorrect accuracy and relative position data, see [this issue](https://github.com/alexholcombe/nStream/issues/1). This isn't the case for pilot data, but affects everything collected from 3/5/17 
	* The first participant was affected by the bug. Their data are useless. The bug was resolved afterwards
* I cancelled the third participant's data collection (4/5/17) because the eyetracker failed to register her eye.
