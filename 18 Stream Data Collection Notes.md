#Data Collection Notes for the 18 streams experiment

* AW1
	* First file (now deleted) was the output of an accidental autopilot run. Only two trials.
	* The experiment proper was split in half because `trialsPerCondition` was incorrect
* JH
	* This participant blinked a lot - 2-3 times a trial - and the eyetracker had to be recalibrated every other trial. I cancelled her participation
